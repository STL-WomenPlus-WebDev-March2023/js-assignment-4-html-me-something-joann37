               <p class="double">Vinnito is a 10 week old curious little goldendoddle. He can be super busy throughout the  day and between his many naps. Upon waking in the morning he begans his day looking for food. After he finds his favorite food, he is off to chase his dreams. <br><br> Besides his food, there are a few other favorites that Vinni enjoys:</p>

               <h2>Car Rides</h2>
               <p class="funParagraph"; class="double">Vinni loves his car rides, so much that he gets super excited when he hears a set of keys. He rides on the front passenger seat with his doggie belt and his favorite car toy, Mr. Whaley. Mr. Whales is soft and cuddley. If Mr. Whaley is placed on the back seat for some reason, Vinni will try his best to retrieve his favorite car toy before we take off. Sometimes he falls asleep while enrout to a destination.</p>

               <h2> Park Visits</h2>
               <p class="double">Park visits are a highlight in the life of Vinni. You mention the work "Park" and his ears perk up. Once arriving at the park, Vinni begans whinning to exit the vehicle. He becomes so excited for all the sights and sounds of the park. Vinni will chase birds, squirrels and rabbits along the way. Vinni is often seen inside Forest Park enjoying the day or evening along with his furry friends.</p>

               <h2>Chew Toys</h2>
               <p class="double">Vinni absolutely loves his chew toys as well as his plush toys. He always find time to chew on his favorite toy at any time day or night. Vinni will hide his beloved toys in all sorts of areas of the house. We are constantly replacing or washing is toys. It's safe to say he is "tuff on toys.</p>

               <h2>Bath Time</h2>
               <p class="double">All you have to say is "bath", he gets himself in and patiently awaits. Vinni often attempts to enter the bath when his humans are preparing to make use of it. He splashes and spashes until he's instructed otherwise. I guess it good to say "bath time is the best time."     </p>

               <h2>Power Naps</h2>
               <p class="double">Power naps are a must in the day and life of the Venturesome Vinni. He will actually play himself to sleep. One minute he can be seen wrestling with his all time favorite toy and then, boom!!!. Vinni is out cold. Something of a cute evevnt to observe. All of a sudden he wakes up and picks up where he left off, some sort of adventure. Nap times and bed times are no problem for this active pup.</p>

               <h2>People</h2>
               <div>Sitting and people watching has become an extreme sport for Vinni. If someone should stop and call him cute or want to pet him, he melts with enjoyment.  Vinni especially enjoy being around children. The smaller the better. Vinni jumps, turns and runs with excitement as he encounter various people. I guess you can say he is a peoples pup. </diiv>
